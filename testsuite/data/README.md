# GeoJson-Test-Data

GeoJson-polygon data are created at [geojson.io](http://geojson.io/)
Polygons are created for following cases:

1. polygon lies only in single federal state: polygon\_{xx}.geojson with {xx} acronym of federal state
1. polygon lies in multiple federal states (here: in HB and NI): polygon_HB_NI.geojson
1. polygon lies not in Germany: polygon_notDE.geojson
1. polygon lies partly in German federal state (here: in NRW) and partly not in Germany
