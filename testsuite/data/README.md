# GeoJson-Test-Data

GeoJson-polygon data are created at http://geojson.io/
Polygons are created for following cases:
    1. polygon lies only in single federal state: polygon_{xx}.geojson with {xx} acronym of federal state
    2. polygon lies in multiple federal states (here: in HB and NI): polygon_HB_NI.geojson
    3. polygon lies not in Germany: polygon_notDE.geojson
    4. polygon lies partly in German federal state (here: in NRW) and partly not in Germany
